        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I chose Chip8 as a project as i heard it was easy and an introduction to 'emulation' 
            <br>
            This project helped further my understanding of basic computer science concepts like the "fetch decode execute" cycle
            <br>
            whilst being an extremely fun project
            <br>
            <br>
            This was my first ever real 'project' and the end result made me feel overly confident in my skills
            <br>
            <br>
            Full source code avaliable on GitHub (its not the best dont judge me)
            <br>

        <h2>Struggles and issues</h2>
        <p>TODO</p>

        <h2>End Result</h2>
        <p>
            The end result after working on this with my little free time was a satisfying somewhat working emulator
            <br>
            enough rambling here are the results
            <br>
